to run the interface, simply click on userinterface.jar.

NOTE: To enter the information inside of the box, simply click "enter" when you complete the form. 

As of 12.8.2021, I haven't yet configured enter to go to the next indexed line,
however this baseline program should do everything the Trauma Cuff GUI was initially supposed to do during 
the Engineering Project competetition. (Of course switching the indexed XML file to JSON)

12.12.2021:
Added Error Handling for empty inputted lines (JSON will not be created when lines are empty)

//TO-DO 
-Add String randomizer for filename.
-Have Enter key transition focus to next available input.
-Create Server Side Java Applet.

NOTICE: PROJECT ABANDONED! 

Abandoned to work on a new AES encryption software. Feel free to use this code as you wish.
